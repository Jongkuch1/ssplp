PART A: PROJECT PROPOSAL
1.0 Project Identification
Project Title: South Sudan Personalized Learning Platform (SSPLP)
Project Sponsor: Independent Project
Prepared by: Jongkuch Isaac Chol Anyar
Date: September 28, 2025
2.0 Project Overview
The South Sudan Personalized Learning Platform is an educational technology solution that aims to solve the acute learning gaps in South Sudan by availing personalized, accessible and quality educational resources to students. The platform uses adaptive learning technology to support individual student needs in low-resource settings.
3.0 Problem Statement
The educational crisis in South Sudan is one of the most severe in the world, and there are more than 2.2 million children without education, not to mention that only 27% of the population is literate (UNESCO, 2023). The education system has poor infrastructure, teaching resources and also disruptions. The students do not have access to good learning resources and individual attention, thus their performance is poor.
WHO: South Sudanese students especially at the secondary level.
WHAT: The inaccessibility of individual learning materials and professional tutoring.
WHEN: Continuous crisis that is aggravated by conflict and economic struggles.
WHERE: At the national level all over South Sudan, and in rural and underserved locations.
WHY: There is a lack of learning opportunities due to inadequate educational facilities and lack of teachers.
HOW:  Existing solutions are inadequate, un-personalized and do not reach the majority of the students.
4.0 Proposed Solution
SSPLP provides a comprehensive educational platform featuring:
Individual student level adaptive learning modules.
Distance tutoring programs with teachers.
Tracking of progress and analytics of performance.
Educational resources which could be used offline in low-connectivity regions.
Multi-language (English and Arabic) in line with the curriculum.
Unique Value Proposition: SSPLP, unlike generic educational platforms, is created specifically in the context of South Sudan, and the contents are in line with the national curriculum and optimized in low-bandwidth conditions.
5.0 Software Development Methodology
Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model
Justification: Agile approach is the best match to this educational project because of the necessity of the constant feedback provided by students, teachers, the changing requirements in terms of the user testing, and making incremental improvements that directly correspond to the needs of the users.
Development Phases:
Sprint 0: Gathering the requirements by means of surveys among South Sudanese students and teachers.
Sprint 1-2: Authentication and system management of students profile.
Sprint 3-4: preparation of adaptive learning modules and content control.
Sprint 5-6: Tutoring site, which has scheduling and a virtual classroom.
Sprint 7-8 Analytics dashboard and progress tracking implementation.
Testing & Deployment: Pilot testing on specific South Sudanese schools.
6.0 Hypothesis
When SSPLP is regularly used among South Sudanese secondary school students, the average performance of the students will increase by a minimum of 40 percent in 6 months relative to those who do not use it. This will be done by having individualized learning tracks, distance tutoring, and offline access that is geared towards the South Sudan education setting.
